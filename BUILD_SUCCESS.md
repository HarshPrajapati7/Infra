## üéØ Deploy to Netlify - 3 Methods

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the `frontend/dist` folder onto the page
3. Your site will be live in seconds!
4. **Note**: You'll need to manually set environment variables

### Method 2: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
3. Choose GitHub and select `HarshPrajapati7/Infra` repository
4. Configure build settings:
   ```
   Base directory: frontend
   Build command: npm install && npm run build
   Publish directory: frontend/dist
   ```
5. Add environment variable:
   - **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-backend-api.com/api` (update with your backend URL)
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Method 3: Netlify CLI (Advanced)
```bash
# Install CLI (one time)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy from project root
cd "h:\ikam apps\project"
netlify deploy --prod
```

## üîß Backend Deployment Required

Your frontend is ready, but you need to deploy the backend separately:

### Backend Deployment Options:

1. **Render** (Recommended for FastAPI)
   - Free tier available
   - Automatic HTTPS
   - Easy Python deployment
   - https://render.com

2. **Railway**
   - Simple deployment
   - PostgreSQL support
   - https://railway.app

3. **Heroku**
   - Classic PaaS
   - Requires credit card
   - https://heroku.com

4. **PythonAnywhere**
   - Python-focused hosting
   - https://pythonanywhere.com

5. **AWS/GCP/Azure**
   - Enterprise options
   - More complex setup

### After Backend Deployment:
1. Copy your backend URL (e.g., `https://api.yourapp.com`)
2. Update Netlify environment variable `VITE_API_URL`
3. Add Netlify domain to backend CORS settings

## üìã Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Frontend deployed to Netlify
- [ ] Backend deployed (choose platform above)
- [ ] Update `VITE_API_URL` in Netlify environment variables
- [ ] Configure CORS on backend to allow Netlify domain
- [ ] Test API connectivity from deployed frontend
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Configure SSL/HTTPS (automatic on Netlify)
- [ ] Test all features in production
- [ ] Monitor error logs

---

## üîê CORS Configuration

Add to your FastAPI backend (`main.py`):

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:5173",  # Local development
        "https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app",  # Netlify URL
        "https://yourdomain.com"  # Custom domain (if any)
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## üß™ Test Production Build Locally

Before deploying, test the production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run preview
```

Visit: http://localhost:4173

## üìä Performance Optimizations Applied

‚úÖ Code splitting (React, Charts separated)
‚úÖ Minification with esbuild
‚úÖ Gzip compression ready
‚úÖ Lazy loading components
‚úÖ Optimized bundle sizes
‚úÖ Tree shaking enabled
‚úÖ Source maps disabled (production)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build fails on Netlify?
- Check Node.js version (set to 18 in netlify.toml)
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

### API calls return 404?
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set in Netlify environment variables
- Check backend is deployed and accessible
- Verify API endpoints are correct

### Blank page after deployment?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify base path in vite.config.js is '/'
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Verify all redirects in netlify.toml

### CORS errors?
- Add Netlify domain to backend CORS allowed origins
- Check backend middleware configuration
- Verify backend is accepting requests from frontend domain

---

## üìû Need Help?

1. Check `NETLIFY_DEPLOY.md` for detailed instructions
2. Review Netlify build logs for errors
3. Test build locally with `npm run preview`
4. Check backend CORS configuration
5. Verify environment variables are set correctly

---

## üéâ Success Metrics

Once deployed, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Frontend accessible at Netlify URL
- ‚úÖ API calls connecting to backend
- ‚úÖ Database operations working
- ‚úÖ Document upload functioning
- ‚úÖ Natural language queries processing
- ‚úÖ Real-time analytics displaying
